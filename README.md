# ColorPicker
> NOTE: This project is in a severe backlog, I will get back to it when I actually learn C++ and CSS and stuff

A project that aims to remake the beautiful colour picker included in Microsoft Powertoys Utility on Linux

## Planning

* I plan on using the [Gpick](https://github.com/thezbyg/gpick) project as my base. 

* This will basically just be a fork of Gpick to make it have the same UI and some tweaked features as the [colorPicker utility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker) from Microsoft's [powertoys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys).
